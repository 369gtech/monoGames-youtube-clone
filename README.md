# monoGames youtube clone

Thank you to [JS Mastery](https://jsmastery.pro/youtube) for your wonderful free course. I am cloning apps to see if they would be applied to monoGames. If you would like to create this youtube clone then head over to the github repository https://github.com/adrianhajdin/project_youtube_clone for further information.

If you have any issues, questions or would like help then please feel free to reach out to my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nftcryptomix) handle and PM me for more information.
